Here's a list of Hack The Box machines focused on container and Kubernetes exploitation, 
ranked by general difficulty from easier to harder based on user feedback and official HTB content:

Beginner/Easy Level


Cap - This box involves Docker misconfiguration for privilege escalation, 
and itâ€™s an excellent starting point for learning about basic container enumeration and exploitation.


Intermediate Level

Trickster - This box involves Kubernetes misconfigurations. 
The challenge revolves around enumerating Kubernetes resources and leveraging misconfigured RBAC permissions.

Tabby - Contains Docker misconfigurations and provides a good blend of web application vulnerabilities leading to container-based escalation.

Olympus

Advanced Level


Cache - This machine dives deep into Kubernetes, 
exploiting secrets management and misconfigurations in Kubernetes clusters.


Chaos - Involves complex Kubernetes misconfigurations and requires an in-depth understanding 
of Kubernetes privilege escalation tactics, making it a challenging box for seasoned practitioners.

These are some of the notable machines to practice container and Kubernetes security. For up-to-date information, you may want to check user discussions on the
