# Kubernetes & Container Security: Hacking and Attack Vectors

## Overview

This repository explores **Kubernetes** security from the perspective of **container hacking** and various types of **attacks** that can target containerized environments. Kubernetes is widely used for orchestrating containers at scale, but like any complex system, it has vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers. Understanding these threats and learning how to mitigate them is crucial for maintaining a secure containerized infrastructure.

This repository provides an in-depth guide to Kubernetes security, including common attack vectors, attack techniques, and best practices for securing both containers and the orchestration platform.

## Introduction

Kubernetes is a powerful platform for managing containerized applications, but it can be vulnerable if not properly configured. Attackers can exploit weaknesses in both the containers themselves and the underlying orchestration platform. This repository focuses on the various techniques used by attackers to compromise Kubernetes environments, including **container breakout**, **API server exploitation**, and more.

By understanding these attacks, developers and security professionals can better defend against them and harden their Kubernetes infrastructure.

## Types of Attacks

### 1. **Container Breakout**
   - **Description**: A container breakout occurs when an attacker gains access to the host system from within a container. Containers are supposed to be isolated, but a vulnerability in the container runtime (like Docker or containerd) or misconfigurations in the container can allow an attacker to escape the container and interact directly with the host.
   - **Impact**: Once a container breakout happens, the attacker can access the host system, compromise other containers, and potentially escalate privileges within the cluster.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Use **AppArmor** or **SELinux** for enforcing strong isolation.
     - Keep container runtimes updated to avoid known vulnerabilities.

### 2. **Kubernetes API Server Exploitation**
   - **Description**: The Kubernetes API server is a critical component of the control plane that handles all API requests. If an attacker gains access to the API server, they can manipulate resources in the cluster, including pods, deployments, and secrets.
   - **Impact**: Attackers can escalate privileges, inject malicious workloads, or exfiltrate sensitive data.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Use **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to enforce strict access control policies.
     - Enable **API server audit logs** to monitor suspicious activity.
     - Use **API rate limiting** to mitigate excessive request volumes.

### 3. **Privilege Escalation**
   - **Description**: Privilege escalation occurs when an attacker gains higher levels of access within the system than originally granted. This can happen if there are misconfigured Kubernetes permissions, such as overly permissive roles or service accounts.
   - **Impact**: Attackers can escalate from a low-privileged user to a root user or compromise the control plane.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Use the principle of **least privilege** when configuring service accounts and roles.
     - Regularly audit permissions and use **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to enforce them.

### 4. **Insecure Secrets Management**
   - **Description**: Kubernetes allows for the management of sensitive data (e.g., API keys, passwords) through **Secrets**. Misconfigured or unencrypted secrets can be exploited if they are stored or transmitted in an insecure manner.
   - **Impact**: Sensitive information could be exfiltrated, allowing attackers to access external services or systems.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Encrypt secrets using **KMS** (Key Management Service) or similar tools.
     - Never store secrets in the container's environment variables or in plaintext.

### 5. **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks**
   - **Description**: A DoS attack aims to disrupt the availability of the Kubernetes infrastructure, often by exhausting resources such as CPU, memory, or network bandwidth.
   - **Impact**: The attack could degrade cluster performance, impact the availability of workloads, or cause a complete service outage.
   - **Mitigations**:
     - Implement **resource limits** and **requests** to avoid overconsumption of resources.
     - Use **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)** to automatically scale workloads based on demand.

## Attack Methods

### Privilege Escalation in Kubernetes
   - **Attack Scenario**: An attacker compromises a container with minimal privileges, then exploits misconfigured RBAC or insecure settings in Kubernetes to escalate to a more privileged role.
   - **Common Attack Vectors**:
     - Abuse of overly permissive RBAC roles.
     - Exploitation of Kubernetes default service accounts, which have broad privileges.

### Attacking Pod-to-Pod Communication
   - **Attack Scenario**: Kubernetes allows pod-to-pod communication within a cluster, but attackers can leverage this to move laterally between pods.
   - **Common Attack Vectors**:
     - Exploiting insecure network policies or misconfigured service meshes.
     - Lateral movement by hijacking inter-pod communications.

### Exploit Kubernetes RBAC Misconfigurations
   - **Attack Scenario**: Misconfigured RBAC permissions may grant excessive privileges to service accounts or users, allowing attackers to perform actions that they should not be able to.
   - **Common Attack Vectors**:
     - Misconfigured `ClusterRole` or `Role` bindings.
     - Service accounts with admin-level privileges.

---

## Mitigation Strategies

1. **Security Hardening**:
   - Apply the principle of **least privilege** to Kubernetes roles, users, and service accounts.
   - Use **Network Policies** to control pod-to-pod communication.
   - Secure container images by regularly scanning for vulnerabilities and using trusted registries.

2. **Secrets Management**:
   - Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit.
   - Use Kubernetes Secrets with encryption enabled, and store secrets securely.

3. **Monitoring and Auditing**:
   - Enable Kubernetes **audit logs** to track access to critical resources.
   - Use tools like **Falco** or **Kube-bench** to detect suspicious activity in your environment.

4. **Regular Updates**:
   - Keep Kubernetes and all related components up to date with the latest security patches.
   - Regularly update container runtimes to prevent known exploits.

## Conclusion

Securing a Kubernetes cluster is an ongoing process that requires vigilance and proactive defense strategies. By understanding common attack vectors and implementing proper security practices, teams can safeguard their environments against the most common Kubernetes and container-based threats.
